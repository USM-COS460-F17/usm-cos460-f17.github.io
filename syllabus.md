Course Description
A description of computer networks organized as a layered architecture based on the OSI Reference Model. Protocols and services of each layer are examined in detail. Specific local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks will be considered. Prerequisites: COS 285, COS 251. Cr 3. 
- USM Course Catalog

The focus of the course will be on understanding and utilizing the Internet (TCP/IP) protocol stack. Students will write network client and server applications in addition to reading and discussing the theory behind modern data communication networks.

The class is dual-listed as an undergraduate (COS 460) and graduate course (COS 540); graduate students will have additional reading and must prepare a presentation for the class (see below).
Course Objectives
The objectives of the course are as follows.
The layering scheme of network protocols and how layers are implemented (c and i).
The options available at each layer of the network and protocols used (c and i).
How local networks work and how they interconnect to form inter-networks and the Internet (c and i).
How application layer protocols are developed and used in practice (c and i). Including but not limited to:
DNS - Domain Name Service
DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
SMTP - Simple Mail Transport Protocol
How develop network server and client applications (k and f).

The lettered items above indicate the USM Computer Science curriculum learning objectives as follows:

(c) An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.
(f) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
(i) An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice.
(k) An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity.
Prerequisites and Expectations
COS 285, COS 251.


The course involves a fair amount of independent learning, experimentation, and work. Internet resources on network programming are plentiful and class time is limited. You will be expected to read (or at least skim and absorb) enough of these materials to be prepared for class.
Textbook
You will use the textbook in and out of class. The examinations will combine material from in-class discussion and the textbook. The textbook is the reference for the course. All textbook material may not be covered during in-class discussions, yet you will still be responsible to demonstrate an understanding of it on the examinations.

Computer Networks: A Systems Approach, Fifth Edition, L. L. Peterson and B. S. Davie, Morgan Kaufmann, 2011.

Amazon.com lists this textbook as Computer Networks, Fifth Edition: A Systems Approach (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Networking) (Hardcover) for $56.24.

The Publisher maintains a site for the book and book extras at http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123850591/

Projects
The course is partially project-based. There will be four (4) programming projects throughout the course. The projects will require you to develop network client and server programs. They will be graded both on how they work and how they are constructed and documented. You can use most any modern programming language (Java, C, C++, or python). If you intend on using something out of the ordinary -- not used in the curriculum -- please contact the instructor prior to beginning for approval.

Your code will be submitted on Blackboard (www.courses.maine.edu) to an “assignment” for each project. Details on what needs to be submitted will be included with each assignment. In all cases, you should submit only source code, no binary executable files. 

Your code must compile and run on systems other than your own, specifically the CS Cluster and/or the instructor's system. Be diligent not to include absolute paths or other common mistakes that prevent your code being compiled and executed on other systems.

Code should work and be your own creation. There are numerous sources of information on the Internet, including code. However, your submissions should be your own work not that of others cut-and-pasted into your projects or that of your classmates. Plagiarism is a serious offence and will be treated accordingly.

The questions on the examinations will be a combination of material in the assigned sections of the book and what is discussed in class. The questions at the end of each chapter in the book are an excellent reference for what to expect on the examination questions.

The examinations will be conducted within Blackboard (www.courses.maine.edu). Each exam will be available to you on the day of the exam and require you to complete all the questions within a specific time duration (typically the same as the class meeting duration). Examinations will be automatically graded and your results immediately available for all non-essay answers.

Research Summary Paper and Presentation (COS 540 Only)
The graduate course includes writing a research summary paper and presentation of the material to the class. The presentations will be approximately 30 minutes in length. 

The schedule of presentations is available via [Google Calendar when available] with your University UserID. Presentation slots will begin the second week of class and end the week before final exams. They will be be self-assigned, first-come first-choice.
