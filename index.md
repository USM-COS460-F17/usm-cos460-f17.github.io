## Introduction

USM Course Catalog: *A description of computer networks organized as a layered architecture based on the OSI Reference Model. Protocols and services of each layer are examined in detail. Specific local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide area networks will be considered. Prerequisites: COS 285, COS 251. Cr 3.*

The focus of the course will be on understanding and utilizing the Internet (TCP/IP) protocol stack. Students will write network client and server applications in addition to reading and discussing the theory behind modern data communication networks.

The class is dual-listed as an undergraduate (COS 460) and graduate course (COS 540); graduate students will have additional reading and must prepare a presentation for the class
